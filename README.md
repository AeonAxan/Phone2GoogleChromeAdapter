By default when you share a link from Pulse (Android) to Phone 2 Google Chrome (Android) it does not work. This is a small app which interfaces between the both so you can share links from Pulse to Phone 2 Google Chrome

Install this app and when you want to share a link from Pulse to Phone 2 Google Chrome, share it instead with this app and it will automatically forward the intent to Phone 2 Google Chrome in a format it understands
 - Pulse (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphonso.pulse&hl=en)
 - Phone 2 Google Chrome (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lg.valle.phone2chrome&hl=en)
